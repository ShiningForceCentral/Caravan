# CARAVAN
Personal attempt at getting into BNC's "The Caravan" Shining Force 2 editor, in order to make it work with SF2 disassemblies.
Original Caravan version is v0.6 UNSTABLE from 30/08/2009.
Main goal is to adapt The Caravan to make it work on split disassemblies with SF2 data format.
Will be shared with BNC as soon as a Proof-of-Concept is available and convincing enough to discuss about The Caravan's future.
